# Welcome to the Lair of the Hun Bun
>This project was built as a game jam to help introduce myself and others to Phaser JS.
>Thanks to W Clarkson for providing utility classes on phasergames.com.
>Adapted from the Phaser 3 Prject Template (https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template)

# A Short Overview:
>Local version is on branch 'development'
>Production mode for amplify is on branch 'amplifydeploy'

All game code is in /src:
>assets (though assets in production are served from S3)
>util (utilities borrowed from W Clarkson)
>scenes (we have two: Start for the start screen, and Level1 for the first level)
index (the main brain)
